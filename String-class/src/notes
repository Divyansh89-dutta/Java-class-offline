What is complexity?
how fast it runs -> time complexity
how uch memory it uses -> space complexity
Complexity ≠ actual seconds of execution.
It tells how performance changes as input grows.
example :-
if code runs for 10 numbers, what if you have 10000 or 1,000,000 number?
complexity helps predict that!
🔹 1. Time Complexity

Time complexity measures how many steps (operations) your code needs as input size N grows.

Think of it as:

How many times will my loop or statement execute for N elements?

Example 1: Constant Time — O(1)
int a = 10;
System.out.println(a);
only 1 step - no matter what N is
time complexity o(1) -> constant

Example 2: Linear Time — O(N)
for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
Runs N times.
If N = 5 → 5 prints,
Time Complexity: O(N) → Linear.

Example 3: Quadratic Time — O(N²)
for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        System.out.println(i + "," + j);
    }
}
For every i, loop runs N times again.
Total steps = N × N → N² steps
Time Complexity: O(N²) → Quadratic.

Example 4: Logarithmic — O(log N)
int i = 1;
while(i < N) {
    i = i * 2;  // doubles each time
}
Values of i: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, …
Stops when i > N
So only log₂(N) steps.
Time Complexity: O(log N) → Logarithmic.

Example 5: Exponential — O(2ⁿ)
void recur(int n) {
    if(n == 0) return;
    recur(n - 1);
    recur(n - 1);
}
Each call makes 2 more calls.
So total calls grow like 2ⁿ.
Time Complexity: O(2ⁿ) → Exponential (very slow).

Order of Common Complexities (Fast → Slow)
| Complexity | Name        | Example                |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| O(1)       | Constant    | Access array element   |
| O(log N)   | Logarithmic | Binary Search          |
| O(N)       | Linear      | Single loop            |
| O(N log N) | Log-linear  | Merge Sort, Quick Sort |
| O(N²)      | Quadratic   | Nested loops           |
| O(2ⁿ)      | Exponential | Recursion with 2 calls |
| O(N!)      | Factorial   | Permutations           |

2. Big O, Theta, Omega
| Symbol   | Meaning | Case                        |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| **O(N)** | Big Oh  | Worst case (upper bound)    |
| **θ(N)** | Theta   | Average case (middle bound) |
| **Ω(N)** | Omega   | Best case (lower bound)     |
Example:
For Linear Search in an array:

Best Case (Ω(1)): Element found at start

Average Case (θ(N/2)): Middle

Worst Case (O(N)): Element not found

Ignoring Constants and Small Terms

When writing complexity:

Ignore constants (2N → O(N))

Ignore small terms (N² + N → O(N²))

Because for large inputs, the biggest term dominates.

Time Limit and Constraints

💡 Approximation:
A computer performs 10⁸ operations per second.
| Time Limit | Maximum N possible | Complexity |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| 1 second   | 10⁸                | O(N)       |
| 1 second   | 10⁴                | O(N²)      |
| 1 second   | 20                 | O(2ⁿ)      |

5. Space Complexity

Space complexity =
📦 Memory used by inputs + Extra memory (auxiliary space)

int sumArray(int[] arr) {
    int sum = 0;  // local variable → O(1)
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

No new array created → O(1) space.
If you make a new array → O(N) space.

6. When Complexity Grows Too Much (TLE)

If your code takes too long (more than 1 second),
you’ll get a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE).

⚠️ Common causes:

Nested loops with large N

Unnecessary recursion

Not breaking early from loops
